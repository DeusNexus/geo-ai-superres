# Development Plan: GeoAI Super-Resolution Pipeline

This development plan outlines the step-by-step tasks required to implement the GeoAI Super-Resolution Pipeline, from data preparation to modeling and final outputs.

---

## üîÅ Stage 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

**Goal:** Gather and prepare raw satellite data (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, DEM) for downstream tasks.

### Tasks
- [ ] Download raw imagery datasets (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, DEM)
- [ ] Organize into `data/raw/`
- [ ] Apply cloud masking and normalization
- [ ] Extract NDVI, slope, land cover, and water body masks

### Deliverables
- Preprocessed data saved to `data/processed/`
- Masks saved to `data/masks/`

### Notebook
- `notebooks/01_data_preparation.ipynb`

### Scripts (in `src/`)
- `data_processing/preprocessing.py`
- `data_processing/mask_generation.py`

---

## üìà Stage 2: Super-Resolution Modeling

**Goal:** Train EHNet to enhance the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement EHNet architecture
- [ ] Prepare training pairs (low-res vs high-res) from Sentinel-2 imagery
- [ ] Train model and tune hyperparameters
- [ ] Save trained model to `models/superres_model.pth`
- [ ] Generate super-resolved imagery

### Deliverables
- Super-resolved images in `data/superres/`
- Trained weights in `models/`

### Notebook
- `notebooks/02_superresolution_training.ipynb`

### Scripts (in `src/`)
- `models/ehnet.py`
- `utils/training.py`

## üåø Stage 3: Land Cover Classification

**Goal:** Classify super-resolved imagery into land cover types.

### Tasks
- [ ] Label training data or use existing labeled samples
- [ ] Train a CNN or hybrid model for land cover classification
- [ ] Evaluate model performance (confusion matrix, accuracy)
- [ ] Save model to `models/landcover_model.pth`

### Deliverables
- Classification maps in `outputs/maps/`
- Charts in `outputs/charts/`

### Notebook
- `notebooks/03_land_cover_classification.ipynb`

### Scripts
- `models/landcover_classifier.py`
- `visualization/classification_plots.py`

---

## üìÖ Stage 4: Temporal Analysis

**Goal:** Analyze changes over time (e.g., vegetation, land cover dynamics).

### Tasks
- [ ] Build time-series datasets from `data/temporal/`
- [ ] Visualize NDVI, urban growth, vegetation loss over time
- [ ] Identify seasonal or annual patterns

### Deliverables
- Time-series plots in `outputs/charts/`
- Temporal insights stored in `outputs/reports/`

### Notebook
- `notebooks/04_temporal_analysis.ipynb`

### Scripts
- `data_processing/temporal_aggregation.py`
- `visualization/time_series.py`

---

## üèôÔ∏è Stage 5: Urban Growth Prediction

**Goal:** Predict future urban expansion using historical trends.

### Tasks
- [ ] Aggregate spatial-temporal data (e.g., built-up areas over time)
- [ ] Train predictive model (e.g., LSTM, random forest, or spatial regression)
- [ ] Predict urban spread and visualize growth

### Deliverables
- Urban growth projections in `outputs/maps/`
- Trained model in `models/urban_growth_model.pth`

### Notebook
- `notebooks/05_urban_growth_prediction.ipynb`

### Scripts
- `models/urban_predictor.py`
- `visualization/urban_growth.py`

---

## ‚úÖ Final Stage: Documentation & Packaging

**Goal:** Finalize project for reproducibility and public release.

### Tasks
- [ ] Write full `README.md` with architecture and results
- [ ] Include usage examples and model architecture diagram
- [ ] Package scripts and notebooks with clear instructions
- [ ] Push to GitHub with version control

### Files
- `README.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `requirements.txt`
- `LICENSE`
